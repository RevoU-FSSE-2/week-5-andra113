Hey there! 👋🏻 I'm Andra, and I created this company profile website to fulfill an assignment for the RevoU Full Stack Software Engineering course.

The assignment requires me to create a company profile site, and I've chosen to focus on a hypothetical startup company in the field of Mental Health.

##Website looks

for some reason when I deployed it to custome domain it shows weird so here is [netlify](beamish-lokum-9af088.netlify.app) link while I'm trying to fix it
